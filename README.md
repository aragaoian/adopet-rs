# About

Adopet was developed during the Software Engineering II course as part of an extension project. aiming to positively impact the community by applying knowledge acquired at the university. </br>
After analyzing other pet adoption websites, we were engaged to create a pet adoption website to help adopters find their ideal companion and reduce common adoption issues, such as pet abandonment, by recommending pets based on the user preferences. </br>

We achieve this by using machine learning techniques and information gathered through a questionnaire completed during the registration process.
