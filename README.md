# Adopet  - Pet Recommendation System
Recommender System Based on Feature-Weighted Content-Based Filtering
Developed during the Software Engineering II course as part of an extension project, this system aims to positively impact the community by applying knowledge acquired at the university. </br>

Our main goal is to help adopters find their ideal companion and reduce common adoption issues, such as pet abandonment. We achieve this by using information gathered through a questionnaire completed during the registration process.
